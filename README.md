# model-deployment-using-flask


## Overview

This project involves deploying a machine learning model using Flask for predicting housing prices based on the Boston Housing Dataset. The model is trained using a neural network implemented with Keras.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`app.py`**: The main Flask application for serving the model predictions through a web interface.
- **`style.css`**: CSS file for styling the web interface.
- **`your_model.h5`**: The trained Keras model saved in HDF5 format.
- **`templates`**: Folder containing HTML templates for the web interface.
    - **`index.html`**: HTML file for the feature input form.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/model-deployment-project.git
    cd model-deployment-project
    ```



## Usage

1. you may want to create .venv and install your libraries
1. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.
2. Enter values for the housing features in the form.
3. Click the "Predict" button to get the model's prediction.

## Project Details

- **Dataset**: The model is trained on the Boston Housing Dataset, which includes various features related to housing in the Boston, MA area.

- **Model Architecture**: The neural network model is implemented using Keras with a specific architecture defined in `app.py`.

- **Web Interface**: The Flask application provides a simple web interface for users to input features and receive predictions.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the project to meet your specific needs. You can update the HTML templates, CSS styles, or even modify the model architecture based on your requirements.
